  * Eric Widmaier (Boston University), Hershel Raff (Medical College of Wisconsin), and Kevin Strang (University of Wisconsin) have taken on the challenge of maintaining the strengths and reputation of Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function. Moving beyond the listing of mere facts, it stresses the causal chains of events that constitute the mechanisms of body function. The fundamental purpose of this textbook is to present the principles and facts of human physiology in a format that is suitable for undergraduates regardless of academic background or field of study.
